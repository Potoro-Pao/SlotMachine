This Project goes with LayaAir 2.0. So... have to download it. And the nodejs has to be the version under 10. Mine is 10.24.1.
Was Supposed to be in the LayaAir Practice loll. Anyway, I think it's acceptable to be here.
I want to try to create a slot machine.
This is the first reel I made to spin.
Simply Press The Spin Button to Spin and Stop Button to Stop.
